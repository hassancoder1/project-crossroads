**Project Crossroads**

**A Next.js Payment Gateway for Pakistan**

**Description:**

Project Crossroads aims to bridge the gap in Pakistan's online payment landscape by providing a robust and secure web-based payment gateway for individuals, merchants, and international transactions. Built with Next.js on the front and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) on the backend, it offers a comprehensive suite of features to streamline financial transactions.

**Features:**

- **Seamless Payments In & Out:** Transfer funds between accounts, wallets, and bank accounts effortlessly.
- **QR Code-Based Merchant Payments:** Empower merchants with convenient QR code solutions for accepting in-store payments.
- **Scheduled Payments:** Automate recurring payments for bills, subscriptions, and other commitments.
- **Payment Request Functionality:** Easily request funds from friends, family, or colleagues.
- **Payment Links:** Generate secure and shareable payment links for online transactions.
- **Payment APIs:** Let other businesses use our payment wallet by providing a public API system.
- **Account Management:** For Now We can rely on a Clerk but later we'll build our own.

Note: Use Tailwind 4 alpha to design UI, Shadcn, and more ready-made resources. Like Cloudinary API for images.

**3DS Compliance:**

Project Crossroads is committed to incorporating 3DS (3-Domain Secure) standards for enhanced security in online card-not-present (CNP) transactions. Integration with a 3DS-compliant payment processor will be a priority during development.

**Current Status:**

The project is currently in its initial phase. A basic repository structure has been established, but active development will commence in May 2024. Anyone free can start the development of this project, I just gave you an idea. I'm currently busy. It's a public repo with no restrictions. So do Npm install and start building now if you are available. Just make sure to write comments for code explanation. No one can stop you from contributing to your loved country Pakistan.

**Idea Came From?**

I Checked all of Pakistan's available payment gateways and wallets like Easypaisa JazzCash, paymob, etc. But All of them are using PHP which is now old fashion compared to large scalable applications. They had made no proper easy ways to let any person implement their gateway easily. PayFast is working fine as I've tried it. https://getstarted.apps.net.pk/signup.
But All of these ask many as many questions from customers while setting up an account and customers are required to call/Contact them manually to set up a gateway on his/her site/app which disappoints customers a lot. I mean your location and ID verification KYC libraries and AI tools to deal with this all stuff.
